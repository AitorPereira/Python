📒 Digital Agenda

Create your own Digital Agenda with Python

Context:

You are developing a small console application to store contacts in a digital agenda.
This agenda will allow you to add, search, and display contacts easily.
The goal is to simulate a simple version of a phone’s contacts application.

🧩 Your Challenge:

You must create two classes in Python:

1. Contact Class
	•	Attributes: name, phone, email.
	•	Special method __str__ to display the contact in a readable way.

2. Agenda Class
	•	Attribute: a list called contacts that stores Contact objects.
	•	Methods:
	•	add_contact(contact) – Adds a contact to the agenda.
	•	search_contact(name) – Returns a contact if it’s found by name.
	•	show_contacts() – Displays all stored contacts.

📟 Example of Use (you must also implement this):

Create an interactive console menu that allows the user to:

--- Menu ---
1. Add contact
2. Search contact
3. Show all contacts
4. Exit

Expected Output:

--- Menu ---
1. Add contact
2. Search contact
3. Show all contacts
4. Exit
Select an option (1-4): 1
Name: Antonio
