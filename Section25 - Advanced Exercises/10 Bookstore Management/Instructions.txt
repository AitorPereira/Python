# Final Project in Python: CLURANTE Graphical ETEC Inter
# Application to manage books using a graphical interface and database

# GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
# - Create a graphical interface to interact with the books (Techint GUI).
# - Store the books in a database (SQLite or similar).
# - Each book will have at least the following fields:
#   - Title
#   - Author
#   - Year
#   - ISBN

# APPLICATION FUNCTIONALITIES:
# 1. View books:
#    - Display all existing books in the database.
#    - Show the fields: Title, Author, Year, ISBN.

# 2. Add books:
#    - Allow entering data for a new book.
#    - "Add" button that saves the book in the database.
#    - Refresh the view to show the added book.

# 3. Update books:
#    - Allow modifying the data of an existing book.
#    - "Update" button that updates the information in the database.
#    - Refresh the view to show the changes.

# 4. Delete books:
#    - Allow removing a book from the database.
#    - "Delete" button that removes the selected book.
#    - Refresh the view to reflect the deletion.

# 5. Search books:
#    - Allow searching for books by a specific criterion (e.g., year).
#    - "Search" button that filters books according to the entered criterion.
#    - Display only the books that match the search.

# 6. Close the application:
#    - "Close" button that safely ends the application.

# IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
# 1. Set up the database to store the books.
# 2. Create the graphical interface with buttons:
#    - View
#    - Add
#    - Update
#    - Delete
#    - Search
#    - Close
# 3. Implement the functionality of each button connecting the GUI with the database.
# 4. Ensure that the interface refreshes correctly after each operation.
# 5. Test the application step by step to confirm that:
#    - Books can be added, updated, deleted, and searched correctly.
#    - The database remains consistent.
#    - The graphical interface responds to user actions.

# NOTES:
# - The implementation will be done in a simple, step-by-step manner.
# - Tkinter is recommended for the GUI and SQLite for the database, but other libraries can be adapted.
# - This final project will allow practicing database integration with graphical interfaces in Python.
