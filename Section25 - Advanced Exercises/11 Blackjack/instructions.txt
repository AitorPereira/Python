# Blackjack Game Rules
# --------------------
# - Add your 2 cards to get as close as possible to 21 without going over.
# - If you go over 21, you lose.
# - J, Q, and K are worth 10 points.
# - The "1" (Ace) can be worth either 1 or 11 points (you can choose whichever benefits you most).
#
# Dealing:
# - The dealer gives you 1 face-up card (visible).
# - The dealer takes 2 cards: 1 face-up (visible) and 1 face-down (hidden).
# - Then you receive a second face-up card (visible).
# => You start with 2 visible cards. The dealer has 1 visible and 1 hidden card.
#
# Gameplay:
# - The dealer asks if you want another card.
#   If you say "yes", you get another face-up card and the dealer asks again.
#   This continues until you say "no" (stop) or until you go over 21 (lose).
#
# Dealer’s turn:
# - Once you stop, the dealer reveals the hidden card.
# - If the dealer’s total is less than 17, they must draw another card.
# - If the dealer has 17 or more, they may continue drawing to try to beat or tie your score.
#
# Winning conditions:
# - You win if your total is <= 21 AND higher than the dealer’s (if dealer hasn’t gone over 21).
# - If the dealer goes over 21, you win.
# - If you go over 21, the dealer wins.
# - If both totals are equal, it’s a tie.
#
# Reminder:
# - The Ace ("1") can count as either 1 or 11, whichever benefits you most.
