# Hotel Reservations
# Description:
#
# You are going to develop a function that simulates a hotel room reservation management system.
# The system should be able to perform the following operations:
#
# Reserve a room: Reserve a room for a customer on a specific date.
# Cancel a reservation: Cancel an existing reservation.
# Check availability: Check if a room is available on a specific date.
# List reservations: List all existing reservations.
#
# Function Requirements:
#
# The main function will be called manage_reservations and will take two parameters:
#
# operation: a string indicating the operation to perform ("reserve", "cancel", "check", "list").
# details: a dictionary containing the necessary details for the operation.
#
# Reservations will be stored in a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a reservation
# with the following details: customer, room, date.
