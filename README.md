# Python Learning Repository

This repo is basically my Python learning journey turned into a collection of exercises and examples.  
I started from the ground up â€” variables, strings, operators â€” and kept adding new sections as I went deeper into the language.  
Over time, itâ€™s grown to cover more advanced stuff like object-oriented programming, error handling, and even working with databases.  

I didnâ€™t want to stop at just the basics, so youâ€™ll also find sections on practical tools like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Seaborn**, as well as some projects with **Tkinter**, automation, and testing.  
To keep it hands-on, Iâ€™ve included plenty of exercises and challenges.  

ðŸ‘‰ Think of it as both my personal record of progress and an open resource for anyone else who wants to practice and get better at Python.
