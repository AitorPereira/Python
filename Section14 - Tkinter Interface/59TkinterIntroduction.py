# Graphical Interface with the Tkinter Module

# Graphical interfaces are visual environments that allow users to interact with our program graphically.

# The tkinter module includes a series of components called Widgets.

# Widgets are graphical components, and in this section we’ll study the following:

# Tk: This is the component that contains all other components — it’s the root element.

# Frame: A frame that can contain other widgets and has its own size.

# Label: A label where we can insert some text.

# Entry: A simple text field to enter short text, such as a name in a form.

# Text: A large text field for writing multiple lines, such as a comment box.

# Button: A button that can be clicked.

# RadioButton: A button to choose one option from several possibilities.

# CheckButton: A button to check/uncheck an option (activated/deactivated).

# Menu: A component to create application menus.

# Dialogs: A component to create popup windows to show information to the user, such as alerts or confirmations.
